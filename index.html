<p>Cookit is a start up that does it's customers food shopping, automatically managing the food budget, selecting choosing healthy and sustainable ingredients and recipes that minimise food waste.  Cookit has just built its service and is currently bidding for funding to improve and expand, and I worked with them in support of a specific bid.</p>

<p>Cookit entered the Nesta Open Food Data challenge, with a potential prize of £40,000.  They had to answer the question “How can we use open data to help people eat more healthily, eat more sustainably and/or have a more secure food chain?”  </p>

<p>We focused on a single question, “How much of the 5 a day of fruit and vegetables is consumed by different socio-economic groups?”  There is a wealth of open data on food in the UK – after searching through these different sources, we found that some very clean, accessible data was published as part of the Family Food Survey, and could very easily answer this question.  The question itself links very closely to the ethos behind Cookit – providing affordable, easy and healthy food to anyone in the UK.</p>

<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h1>

<p>The Family Food Dataset focuses on the consumption habits of the UK population, and provided sufficient detail that we could find how much of the 5 a day is consumed by household income quintile, equivalised decile, age range of the household, the age when the person with the primary household income left school, by region in England and by country in the UK.  I wrote some code to extract the data from the datasets, and reformulate the data into the correct units and into a more accessible form.  My code also plotted the data as a series of bar charts, appropriate for the type of data and readily understood by quite a wide audience.</p>

<h1>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h1>

<p>Although the analysis successfully answered the question we set out to, unfortunately Cookit didn't win, coming a strongly contested 2nd in their heat.  This near-miss has provided Cookit with a number of useful contacts and potential sources for the vital funding.  They are also using this data in a whitepaper on the variation of eating habits with income across the UK, as part of obesity week. </p>
