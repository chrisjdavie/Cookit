This is a reworking of the 5-a-day for a different 
output, where the primary output is a spreadsheet
(instead of the bar charts), and has a different 
sheet for each of salt, sugar, etc.  

If pointed at the correct data, 
'data_out_adpt/save_all_as_xls.py' will produce 
two spreadsheets, one for income decile, another
for income quintile, for the consumption pattern
of a range of foodstuffs and expenditures.
